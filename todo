RadFox University: Maximilian Missions. Complete Task Guide. Part 1. | Showdown Exfil Zone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8AFe8ypIec

This video provides a comprehensive guide to completing the first 18 Maximilian missions in "Contractors Showdown Exfil Zone." The guide covers the objectives, locations, and tips for each mission, with the creator highlighting that some tasks require completion of other trader missions to unlock.

Here's a breakdown of the missions covered:

    Customer First (0:12-0:34): This mission in Suburbs requires you to reach the outdoor driving cinema, find the Maximilian golden goblet, extract, and turn it in.
    Better Safe than Sorry 1 (0:43-1:26): Located in the Apollo Hill area, you need to visit three close-by places marked on the mini-map (truck and loading station, yellowish huts) and then extract.
    Covert Evacuation (1:55-2:32): You are given a bunker exfil key for Suburbs. You need to touch the bunker door and extract from anywhere on the map. The video recommends opening the bunker for rare loot and putting the key in your safe container.
    Into the Rat Hole (2:48-3:04): This mission involves visiting a new area in "Dam," grabbing a golden globe from the middle of a highlighted cave, and turning it in.
    All Pieces Together 1 (3:38-3:50): Submit six notebooks, which can be found on any map by checking doors, boxes, and shelves.
    All Pieces Together 2 (3:55-4:01): Similar to the previous task, you need to submit eight tapes found anywhere.
    Seeing is Believing 1 (4:05-4:22): Grab trackers from a kiosk and mark three special "Conway" tracks in "Dam," which are marked on the mini-map.
    Seeing is Believing 2 (4:38-5:00): Grab a phone from your kiosk and take two pictures of aircraft engines in the new area called "Crash Site" in "Dam." One engine is on the ground, and the other is attached to a plane wing.
    Purge in the Ranks (5:10-5:27): The first mission involving Maximilian golden ingots. Go to the basement of the mall in Suburbs, find the ingots on a table behind the main elevator, and extract.
    Better Safe than Sorry 2 (5:50-6:44): Similar to the first part, go to Suburbs, reach three places near the mall (a house near the bridge, a green tent on the mall parking lot, and a water tower), and successfully extract.
    Don't Play with Fire (6:51-7:28): This task has two parts: submit five combustible items found on a raid (scan with Mika if unsure) and then grab trackers to mark three silos in the farm area of Suburbs.
    Cold Hard Cash 1 (7:35-7:57): Turn in one golden ingot. If you have the DLC, you'll have two; otherwise, you need to find them in key rooms and high-value item spawns.
    Cold Hard Cash 2 (8:00-9:12): Mark five forklifts in "Dam." You're given four markers, so use a spare one from a previous mission or buy more from Ark. Three forklifts are in the docks (two top, one bottom), and two are in the old factory.
    All Pieces Together 3 (9:14-9:25): Turn in six old phones, which are common finds on any map.
    All Pieces Together 4 (9:28-9:44): Turn in four cameras, which are high-value items found in locked rooms, high-value item spawns, or sometimes in boxes.
    Cold Hard Cash 3 (9:47-10:45): Collect three ingots in "Dam." Go to the construction area, kill bosses, climb the ladder to the top, collect the ingots, and use the ladder trick to descend safely.
    Console in Hand (10:53-11:12): Submit a game console and all four different game cartridges. These are found in locked rooms, high-value item spawns, and sometimes in boxes and drawers. The game console is rare.
    Hack to Play (11:13-12:12): Find two discs. One is in the "Dam" power station area, and the other is under the factory "bizone" lock room.

- Key Vault guide for Resort

RadFox University: Key Room Comparison in Resort. What's The Best Vault? | Showdown Exfil Zone 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-B_GviCX2Y 


    Key Room Types: There are six key rooms: three rare, two epic, and one legendary (0:13-0:22).
    Checking for Keys: It's recommended to check all key rooms, even those with worse loot, as most can have key spawns, except possibly the legendary room (0:29-0:37). The legendary Bank 2F key has only been found in Apartment 2F and Sunset Tunnel (0:42-0:50).
    Farming Keys: A good strategy is to start by buying the Hospital key and exchanging it for other keys (0:50-0:57). Keep checking the Hotel and Halifax rooms as well, as other keys can be found there (0:58-1:07).
    Room Comparisons:
        Bank 2F (Legendary): This room (1:39) generally contains only about five items, but they are typically expensive, making it ideal for quick money or finding "elephants" (high-value items) (1:41-1:49).
        Sunset Tunnel (Epic): This room (1:51) is recommended if you need a variety of items for upgrades or better armor, as it contains an average of 17 items (1:53-2:01). It's also the only place on the map with a PC that guarantees CPUs and GPUs (2:01-2:10).
        Hotel 208: This room (2:10) often has a high chance of spawning ammo, mags, guns, raid poison, climbing rope, and gunpowder (2:13-2:22).
        Halifax: This room (2:22) sometimes has a figurine spawn, along with armor and gun crates (2:25-2:31).
        Hospital: Good for finding stimulant injectors (2:31-2:36).
        Apartment 2F: This room is generally good overall (2:37-2:39). If you find a vertical suitcase there, it's highly likely to contain a Bank 2F key (2:41-2:48).

- Key Spawn Guide for Resort

Key spawn locations resort: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ2rjoH0Mpc
    Modern Apartment: Located at the reception, this spot is potentially a static spawn but is less consistent (0:41-1:01).
    Fire Department: On the second floor, in the second room (1:02-1:18).
    Worker's Dorm: In the first house to the left; look for a vertical suitcase (1:19-1:32).
    Hospital (without key room): In the left wing, second floor (1:34-1:43).
    Seafoam Scoops (Ice Cream Shop): The key is visible on the closest table through the window (1:44-2:04).
    Bank 2nd Floor: In the first room on the second floor, to the right of the PC (2:05-2:18).
    Rua Algasol: Look for a vertical suitcase in the house (2:19-2:35).

    Vaults: Most key rooms, except for the basement bank vault and the second-floor bank vault, contain key spawns (2:36-2:58).
    Hospital 2F: A key spawn is on the table, often yielding keys for the Apartment 2F (2:59-3:09).
    Apartment 2F: May contain a vertical suitcase with a Bank 2F key (3:10-3:27).
    Halif Voyage: The spawn is on the table, often yielding metro passcards (3:28-3:35).
    Hotel 208: A rare spawn found on the lowest shelf (3:35-3:40).
    Sunset Tunnel: A rare spawn found on the table, potentially giving Bank 2F or Sunset Tunnel keys (3:41-3:59).

Bank 2F Key is found in the Sunset Tunnel room and Hotel 208.

- Key Vault guide for Smuggling Tunnel

Smuggling Tunnel Key Vault Locations: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JdYsMU3iUY 

Vault Locations
    Cargo Zone 01 Toilet Key (0:00): This vault is located in the toilet room in the cargo area and often contains a good gun crate.
    Checkpoint 2F Room Key (0:36): Another vault in the cargo area, where a floppy disk has a chance to spawn.
    Central Area Secret Room Key (1:22): Accessible via the ventilation room, the most important item here is a key found in a suitcase.
    RH02 Dorm Room Key (2:00): This legendary room is on the third floor, with a key spawn in a suitcase and potential key spawns on a table and elsewhere on the left.
    Cellar Staircase Gate Key (2:50): Located one floor up from the RH02 room, this vault has a key spawn and two safes.
    WH01 Warehouse Key (3:36): Found back down in the warehouse area. The video creator notes they haven't found anything on the table or chair in this location.
    South EMR Control Room Key (4:12): This red door is found by going up the stairs, with a key spawn on the right and sometimes a radio scanner in the corner.
    North EMR Control Room Key (4:57): Located just across from the South EMR Control Room. The video reminds viewers to keep one north and one south key for a task by Maggie.
