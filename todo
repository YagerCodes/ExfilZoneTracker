- Key Vault guide for Resort

RadFox University: Key Room Comparison in Resort. What's The Best Vault? | Showdown Exfil Zone 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-B_GviCX2Y 


    Key Room Types: There are six key rooms: three rare, two epic, and one legendary (0:13-0:22).
    Checking for Keys: It's recommended to check all key rooms, even those with worse loot, as most can have key spawns, except possibly the legendary room (0:29-0:37). The legendary Bank 2F key has only been found in Apartment 2F and Sunset Tunnel (0:42-0:50).
    Farming Keys: A good strategy is to start by buying the Hospital key and exchanging it for other keys (0:50-0:57). Keep checking the Hotel and Halifax rooms as well, as other keys can be found there (0:58-1:07).
    Room Comparisons:
        Bank 2F (Legendary): This room (1:39) generally contains only about five items, but they are typically expensive, making it ideal for quick money or finding "elephants" (high-value items) (1:41-1:49).
        Sunset Tunnel (Epic): This room (1:51) is recommended if you need a variety of items for upgrades or better armor, as it contains an average of 17 items (1:53-2:01). It's also the only place on the map with a PC that guarantees CPUs and GPUs (2:01-2:10).
        Hotel 208: This room (2:10) often has a high chance of spawning ammo, mags, guns, raid poison, climbing rope, and gunpowder (2:13-2:22).
        Halifax: This room (2:22) sometimes has a figurine spawn, along with armor and gun crates (2:25-2:31).
        Hospital: Good for finding stimulant injectors (2:31-2:36).
        Apartment 2F: This room is generally good overall (2:37-2:39). If you find a vertical suitcase there, it's highly likely to contain a Bank 2F key (2:41-2:48).

- Key Spawn Guide for Resort

Key spawn locations resort: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ2rjoH0Mpc
    Modern Apartment: Located at the reception, this spot is potentially a static spawn but is less consistent (0:41-1:01).
    Fire Department: On the second floor, in the second room (1:02-1:18).
    Worker's Dorm: In the first house to the left; look for a vertical suitcase (1:19-1:32).
    Hospital (without key room): In the left wing, second floor (1:34-1:43).
    Seafoam Scoops (Ice Cream Shop): The key is visible on the closest table through the window (1:44-2:04).
    Bank 2nd Floor: In the first room on the second floor, to the right of the PC (2:05-2:18).
    Rua Algasol: Look for a vertical suitcase in the house (2:19-2:35).

    Vaults: Most key rooms, except for the basement bank vault and the second-floor bank vault, contain key spawns (2:36-2:58).
    Hospital 2F: A key spawn is on the table, often yielding keys for the Apartment 2F (2:59-3:09).
    Apartment 2F: May contain a vertical suitcase with a Bank 2F key (3:10-3:27).
    Halif Voyage: The spawn is on the table, often yielding metro passcards (3:28-3:35).
    Hotel 208: A rare spawn found on the lowest shelf (3:35-3:40).
    Sunset Tunnel: A rare spawn found on the table, potentially giving Bank 2F or Sunset Tunnel keys (3:41-3:59).

Bank 2F Key is found in the Sunset Tunnel room and Hotel 208.

Smuggling Tunnel Key Vault Locations: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JdYsMU3iUY 

Vault Locations
    Cargo Zone 01 Toilet Key (0:00): This vault is located in the toilet room in the cargo area and often contains a good gun crate.
    Checkpoint 2F Room Key (0:36): Another vault in the cargo area, where a floppy disk has a chance to spawn.
    Central Area Secret Room Key (1:22): Accessible via the ventilation room, the most important item here is a key found in a suitcase.
    RH02 Dorm Room Key (2:00): This legendary room is on the third floor, with a key spawn in a suitcase and potential key spawns on a table and elsewhere on the left.
    Cellar Staircase Gate Key (2:50): Located one floor up from the RH02 room, this vault has a key spawn and two safes.
    WH01 Warehouse Key (3:36): Found back down in the warehouse area. The video creator notes they haven't found anything on the table or chair in this location.
    South EMR Control Room Key (4:12): This red door is found by going up the stairs, with a key spawn on the right and sometimes a radio scanner in the corner.
    North EMR Control Room Key (4:57): Located just across from the South EMR Control Room. The video reminds viewers to keep one north and one south key for a task by Maggie.
